untgz plugin for NSIS v2
untgz - unzip like replacement plugin, except for gzipped tarballs
KJD <jeremyd@fdos.org>

  This software based on NSIS exDLL (example plugin) and zlib library.
  I personally add no additional copyright, so the license is the
  combination of NSIS exDLL (example plugin) and decompression
  libraries used.  For basic gzip'd tarballs (which rely on zlib),
  this is essentially MIT/BSD licensed.  Support for lzma compressed
  tarballs requires the LZMA files and their LGPL/CPL with exception
  license.  Support for bz2 compressed tarballs requires bzlib (BZip2)
  related files and its BSD-style license.
  
  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
  warranty.  In no event will the authors (or copyright holders) be
  held liable for any damages arising from the use of this software.
